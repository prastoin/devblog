## <BaseAnchor label="Introduction"/>

Manually written tests usually involve a lot of block lack coverage, but also brings a lot a of code depending on your application complexity.
Imagine a wizard form already tested and implemented in an application, a new need appears we have to add a new input between two existing one.
Depending on your test architecture this could bring a lot a complexity in the refactor, as it could spread to be refactoring every wizard form related test legacy environment.
When where with XState/test this could lead to adding a new state inside the tests machine, every possible combination would be covered by the tool.

Between tests getters could not be exactly the same, as for example asserting on a `Label` or a `testId`.
Centralizing interaction with an element allows a strong and controlled assertions on it every time we need.
