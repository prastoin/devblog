The Darkly is 42 Web security pen test project
The objective was to find 14 breaches, each of them giving a flag.
For each breach, we wrote how we found it, how the breach can be exploited and how the breach can be avoided.

At the root of the repository, we created a directory for each breach containing the flag, and optionally the ressources that were needed to find the flag. For instance, we had to find a file containing a flag among 18,000 other files, and we wrote a JavaScript script to help us.
