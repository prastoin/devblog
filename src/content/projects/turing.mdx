Classic Turing and Universal turing machine interpreter and web visualizer.
A turing machine is a state machine, containing states and transitions between states.
Each transitions involves a read input and write on input.

The user has to defined how he wants his Turing machine to work and then submit it to the interpreter that will parse and validate it to finally interpret each transitions before reaching a final state.
