----- Draft

From Jenkins:

- Ternaries
- workflow_call and workflow_dispatch common args
- Invoke reusable workflow Using a specific environment.
  - to be able to compute env related variables to be provided as reusable workflow input
- Required is not really required secrets
- Dynamic input declaration, such as Jenkins Active Choices plugin
- Grouping workflows in the UI as folders
- Being able to add a dynamic label to "deploy your app with github" entries
- Conditional jobs `needs`
- More input types
- Grouping secrets and variables such as USER PASSWORd
- Having description entries for vars and secrets
- Edit and replay current workflow run + be able to read all sub actions "script file"

Should dig deeper before speaking:

- Secrets and vars repo/org auto-completion
- Validating vars and secret before running a pipeline / AKA unknown secrets ?
- Versioning variables and having a configuration as code
- Review previous runs
