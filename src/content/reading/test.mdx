While implementing some authentication logic on an adonis project. I needed at some point to throw a specific http code status
In this case a **403 forbidden**.

Adonis thanks to it's [global exceptions handler](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/exception-handling#handling-exceptions-globally) will manage exceptions for you.

```ts
Route.get("dashboard", async ({ auth, response }) => {
  //If someCode comes to throw an error,
  //then adonis global exception listener will handle it
  await auth.Authenfication();

  // business logic
});

//Instead of usually
Route.get("dashboard", async ({ auth, response }) => {
  if (!auth.isLoggedIn) {
    return response.status(401).send("Unauthenticated");
  }

  // business logic
});
```
