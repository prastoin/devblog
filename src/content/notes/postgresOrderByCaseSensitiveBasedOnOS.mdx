title: PostgresQL collation implementation depending on OS
publishDate: 10 feb 2022

While creating integration tests on an **adonisJS** server connected to a **Postgres** database.
I've faced an issue where javascript sort by string weight wasn't matching to **Postgres** order_by results.
It turns out that **Postgres** uses the collation implementation from the OS he hosted on. [source](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/106964/why-is-my-postgresql-order-by-case-insensitive/131471#131471)<br/>
On a linux OS it's then not case sensitive at all.
Hopefully using docker will easily avoid any further issue in the team you're working with as everyone will be hosting the **Postgres** inside identical docker containers.<br/>
