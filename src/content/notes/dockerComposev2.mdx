title: Difference between docker compose & docker-compose
publishDate: 14 nov 2022

The original but now deprecated version of the `docker-compose` written in Python allowed us to start a container using:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Now the new migrated to Golang version is now a `docker` plugin that starts containers with:

```sh
docker compose up
```

See [Install the compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
