While working on the musicroom we've had to synchronize every app's pages on user authentication updates.
To do so we've been working with the [Broadcast Channels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel). Later I've struggled to remember the exact name of the API we've been using that's why I'm writing it down here.

The `Broadcast Channel API` is a great tool to communicate between several windows/iframes/tabs from the same origin by posting and listening to messages.
In this way on the user log in nor log out from a tab, you could reload every app's pages to avoid unsynced views.

```ts
// Listening to broadcast channel messages
broadcastChannel.onmessage = (event) => {
  switch (event.data) {
    case "RELOAD_BROWSER_TABS": {
      // On message reception logic
      break;
    }
    default: {
      console.error("encountered unknown broadcast channel message");
    }
  }
};

// Sending broadcast channel message
broadcastChannel.postMessage("RELOAD_BROWSER_TABS");

// Disconnecting the channel
broadcastChannel.close();
```
