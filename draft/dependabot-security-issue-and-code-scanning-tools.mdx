# Introduction

What is dependabot ? It does a lot of things.  
It's dependency management tool.

Dependabot main features:

- Dependabot alerts—inform you about vulnerabilities in the dependencies that you use in your repository. (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-dependabot-alerts)
- Dependabot security updates—automatically raise pull requests to update the dependencies you use that have known security vulnerabilities. (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates)
- Dependabot version updates—automatically raise pull requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date. (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)

Importance of upgrading packages:
This helps reduce your exposure to older versions of dependencies. Using newer versions makes it easier to apply patches if security vulnerabilities are discovered, and also makes it easier for Dependabot security updates to successfully raise pull requests to upgrade vulnerable dependencies.

## Version update notes

Interesting sections:

- What is dependabot
- What it does ?
- How to configure it
  . Handling pull request
  . GitHub Actions on dependabot PR
  . Vendored dependency
  . Mononrepo package related PR https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependency-updates
  . Organization dependency

Notes:
A lot of supported package manager

## The worflow of a dependabot alert

### Consumed depdency side

1/ open sourcer/mainteners discovers a security issues
2/ Privately discuss it and fix
3/ Publish a security advisory encouraging community to upgrade
(Remark) 4/ It updates the GitHub advisory Database

### Dependcy consumers

1/ Receives an dependabot alert
2/ Checks security issue applied to its business
3/ Checks project integrity
4/ Merges

# Dependency graph

Interprets the lockfile => One more reason to push the lockfile
Shows transitive dependencies or sub-dependencies
Support a lot of ecosystem even brings solution with beta API to publish your own dependencies if not supported lockfile etc example GO

## The lifecycle of an alert

- Consumed depdency side
  1/ open sourcer/mainteners discovers a security issues
  2/ Privately discuss it and fix
  3/ Publish a security advisory encouraging community to upgrade
  (Remark) 4/ It updates the GitHub advisory Database

- Dependcy consumers
  1/ Receives an dependabot alert
  2/ Checks security issue applied to its business
  3/ Checks project integrity
  4/ Merges

## Configuration

. Handling pull request
. GitHub Actions on dependabot PR combinations  
. Vendored dependency
. Mononrepo package related PR https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/customizing-dependency-updates
. Organization dependency
